# JavaImageServer, Image gallery in 100% Java
Serves IMGs over HTTP and FTP

How to use
----------
Run the app, enter the port number in the HTTP tab and click the start button.
Open your web browser and go to server_ip:port. Locally, this is 127.0.0.1:80
Then the index page opens and shows a bunch of thumbnails.
Click on one and another page opens with the image stretched to page width.
On top are two icons, back and forth, letting you traverse through the image list.
You can also use the cursor keys to accomplish this.
